# Optimization Problems Solving using Linear Programming 

In this project, we tackle a series of optimization problems inspired by real-world industrial scenarios. The main objective is to effectively allocate resources to maximize profits or minimize costs. We use Linear Programming, a powerful mathematical technique, and implement our solutions in Python using the PuLP library.
